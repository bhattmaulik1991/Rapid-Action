# GE’s Predix Sensors :
Predix sensors are used to collect data around the city by using sensors along portal area as well as city area. Rapid Action application requires data such as traffic, pedestrian and also roadside accidental or any other suspicious images to provide an emergency alert to people in the city.
Rapid Action application is using below predix services :
  1. Pedestrian Planning :
    To know exact location of individual nearby node area
  2. Traffic Planning :
    This gives traffic data such as number of vehicles at a specific time, speed, location.
  3. Situational Awareness :
    This give photos or videos collection to know any mishap happened around node.
  4. Predix Logging : to view logs of predix services.
    Along with predix API, Rapid Action application uses USGS’s real time data for earthquake, flood or other natural 
    calamities data to make system more powerful.

# UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY (USGS)
It is a scientific agency of the United States government. The scientists of the USGS study the landscape of the United States, its natural resources, and the natural hazards that threaten it. It provides science about the natural hazards that threaten lives and livelihoods. The data for earthquake and flooding is being accessed from USGS and combined with predix api data for better knowing about event happened or going to happen.
